# Overview of Python example codes
We provide some small python examples in the example sub directory of this repository that demonstrate how you can use the data service RestAPI that is installed on the on-premise compute unit that comes with the drinnenbox. To run these scripts you'll need:
* Python 3.3 or above
* [Python Imaging Library (Pillow)](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/)

Of course these API calls should be easily to port into any other programming language. Alternative under Unix you can use curl or on any Operating System even directly your webbrowser

## helloblindsensor.py
This first example script should get you easily started on how to use the data service API. This example demonstrates how to connect to the data service API and get the current system status (temperatures and if the system is up and running) and current version nummbers of the installed software components on the compute unit.

## getcurrentview.py
