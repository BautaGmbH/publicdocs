# Overview of Python example codes
We provide some small python examples in the example sub directory of this repository that demonstrate how you can use the data service RestAPI that is installed on the on-premise compute unit that comes with the drinnenbox. To run these scripts you'll need:
* Python 3.x
* [Python Imaging Library Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/)
