## Setting up the hardware

The "drinnebox" consists of two major components, the first one is BAUTA's special developed compact sensor unit and the second part is a nVidia Jetson-family on-premise small formfactor compute unit. The two components are connected together via a standard Cat5 ethernet cable through which the data stream from the sensor is submited through to the on-premise compute unit. On the on-premise compute unit the sensor stream is analyzed via a set of specifically trained deep neural networks.
When assembling / setting up the drinnenbox we recommend to start with the sensor unit first
